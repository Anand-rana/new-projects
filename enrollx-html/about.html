                                            <p>The Marketplace is a resource where you can learn about your health
                                                coverage options, compare health insurance plans based on costs,
                                                benefits, and other important features, choose a plan, and enroll in
                                                coverage. The Marketplace also provides information on programs that
                                                help people with low to moderate income and resources pay for coverage.
                                                This includes ways to save on the monthly premiums and out-of-pocket
                                                costs of coverage available through the Marketplace, and information
                                                about other programs, including Medicaid and the Children’s Health
                                                Insurance Program (CHIP). In some states, the Marketplace is run by the
                                                state. In others it is run by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
                                                Services (CMS), a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human
                                                Services (HHS). If you’re applying for health coverage in a state
                                                running its own Marketplace, visit HealthCare.gov and you’ll be
